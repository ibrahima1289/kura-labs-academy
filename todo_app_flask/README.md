## Installation Flask in Python using visio code (Windows 10 and/or Linux)

This project was done by using resources from this website linked [here](https://www.python-engineer.com/posts/flask-todo-app/).

In order to use Flask, it is recommended to have Python 3 installed on your computer.

*Follow the steps below.*

**1. Setup virtual environment**

   * Create an environment 
      $ mkdir project_name
      $ cd project_name
      $ py -3 -m venv virtual_name

**2. Activate the environment**

      $ ./virtual/Scripts/activate (Windows)
      $ . venv/bin/activate (Linux environment)
      
**3. Install Flask**
      
      $ pip install Flask
      
**4.** For the database, we will install SQLAlchemy (See link below for more information about this database).

      $ pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy

**5.** Create a file named **app.py** in the **project_name** folder; write the code for the **todo app**: see source codes for the details.

**7.** Create a folder named **templates** under **project_name** folder. And create a HTML in the **templates** foder.  

### ***Note:** You can find both **app.py** and the HTML file in the source code folder.*
